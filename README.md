# Tutorials #2

You will find on this repo the resources to use for the second tutorial lesson. Next to this `README.md` file, you will find an `index.html` file and an `assets/` folder, where the `CSS` and `Javascript` are located, alongside font files and images.

## Exercice #1

You will find a `artworks` object in the `Ã¬ndex.js` file.

1. You need to create a function that will modify this object when the user clicks on the `.button` and show the result in the `.results` section.
2. The result you should get from the object is: `Far from Home (Print, 2021), Migrations of Memory-Wild Geese Descend on Level Sands IV no. 3 (Painting, 2021), Migrations of Memory-Wild Geese Descend on Level Sands IV, no. 1 (Painting, 2021), Hope Is the Thing with Feathers (The Little Bird) (Print, 2021), Raitra Marosoratra (Textile, 2021)`.

*Hints:* These artworks are only the 5 artworks created in 2021, sorted by `id`.

## Exercice #2

With the same `artworks` object, and **without changing anything in the HTML file**:

1. Create a `ul` element with the class `.list`.
2. Append each of the artwork as a `li` element in this list with the class `.list__item`.
3. Each of these list items should contain the `title`, the `department`, the `date of creation`, the `technique` and the `type`. You are free to create the structure you want in these list items in order to make the content as easy to understand as possible.
